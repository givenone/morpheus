EGSR (Rapid Acquisition of Specular and Diffuse Normal Maps from Polarized Spherical Gradient Illumination Wan-Chun Ma)

- to infer BRDFs across the entire object surface

- spatially-varying BRDFs

- Thus, our four lighting patterns, each photographed under two polarization states, yield the diffuse normal (per color channel), diffuse albedo (per color channel), specular nor-mal, and specular intensity for each pixel.

- Since our technique estimates just the normals and albedo, we use a manually-chosen specular roughness parameter for our renderings

- differences between the specular
and diffuse normals are important for characterizing the re-
flectance of organic materials. From this observation, we
present a real-time hybrid normal shading technique that
uses independent normal maps for the specular channel and
each of the three diffuse color channels.

- combined with cost-effective
structured light scanning to produce 3D models
