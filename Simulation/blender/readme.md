# Blender 

## blender simulation for light stage using bpy module.

- used blender 2.8.2 version. bpy library is highly dependent on the version of blender. I highly recommend you use the proper version of the blender.

- blender.py : codes for deploying objects, camera, lights, frame

- pattern.py : codes for generating light patterns. (Until now, binary gradient and spherical gradient pattern is implemented.)

- rendering.py : codes for rendering. You may change several settings including resolutions, sensor size, and so on for rendering. Used Cycles in blender.
